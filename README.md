# Tacho Bridge Application

![Tacho Bridge Application](src/assets/logo.svg 'Tacho Bridge Application')

The application is designed for use with the flespi platform. Communication with the server is organized through an MQTT channel 'tacho-bridge' that must be created in the user's account. Each card is should be represented in flespi as a separate device of type 'Tacho Bridge Card'.

## Specifications

Project uses [Tauri framework](https://tauri.app/) = [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) + [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)

Quasar will be used as an interface, buttons, menu, etc. It was decided to abandon the native solution offered by Tauri due to possible difficulties with adaptation on different OS, and this will also facilitate the implementation of a mobile interface if required. Also, the native interface requires a bunch of imports that are already in Quasar.

## Getting started

Firstly it is needed to install [Rust](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).

Init project from the root directory

```
npm install
```


Cargo can be updated only from the ./src-tauri directory
```
cargo update
```

Then it is needed fetch Cargo dependeces from the rust directory
```
cd src-tauri
cargo fetch
```

run project

```
npm run tauri dev
```

Build
```
# default build command for the current OS. 
npm run tauri build 

# Build MacOS without signature and notarization.
npm run tauri build -- --target aarch64-apple-darwin    # targets Apple silicon machines.
npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-apple-darwin     # targets Intel-based machines.
npm run tauri build -- --target universal-apple-darwin  # unversal app for x86 and ARM machines.
```

### MacOS code signing and notarization
Сreate a .env file with the variables described below with the specified credentials. IMPORTANT: this file is added to .gitignore, it will not be sent to the repository for the security purposes.
```
APPLE_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (YOUR_TEAM_ID)"
APPLE_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID
APPLE_ID=your.email@example.com
APPLE_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password

# Enable notarization in Tauri 2.0
ENABLE_NOTARIZE=true
```
Then just run the *build-mac.sh* script which will check for the necessary variables, settings and start building a universal bundle that can run on all Mac architectures (x86 & ARM). The binary file will contain code for both architectures, the required one will be selected for launch.

### In-app updates

The TCC uses the signed Tauri updater for automatic updates. The application only installs an update after the downloaded artifact has been verified with the configured public key. If the updater is not configured, or the feed cannot be reached, the application keeps the existing manual-update flow.

A release build must provide the complete updater trust chain through the environment (normally in the release CI secret store or the local `.env` used by `build-mac.sh`):

```dotenv
TAURI_UPDATER_ENDPOINT=https://<release-feed-host>/tcc/{{target}}-{{arch}}.json
TAURI_UPDATER_PUBKEY=<public-key-generated-by-tauri-signer>
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key-generated-by-tauri-signer>
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD=<private-key-password>
```

The endpoint must serve Tauri's signed update manifest for every supported target and architecture. The private key is never committed or sent to the application; only the public key is embedded in the release configuration. `build-mac.sh` rejects a partially configured updater so a release cannot accidentally publish unsigned or unverifiable artifacts. The concrete feed host, key material, and CI secret names remain deployment choices and must be supplied by the release pipeline.

If everything went well, you will see something like:
```

✅ Build completed successfully!

🏁 Script execution completed
```

### Linux building & using
To install system libraries like _libssl-dev, libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev, libgtk-3-dev etc._ you need *sudo* administrator rights. Please be careful when installing new packages and dependencies.  

**[Tauri Core Dependencies](https://v1.tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-linux)**
```
apt install -y build-essential curl wget libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libappindicator3-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev squashfs-tools fuse pkg-config file zlib1g-dev
```
**PCSC Smart Card Support**
```
apt install -y pcscd libpcsclite-dev libccid usbutils
```
**Optional Runtime Libraries.** Recommended if AppImage doesn’t launch or you have theming/display issues.
```
apt install -y libxcb1 libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxrandr2 libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2 libdrm2 libgbm1 libnspr4 libnss3 libpango-1.0-0 libxss1 libxext6 libxtst6
```  

## Icon generating & customizing

The project stores icons in a directory: **src-tauri/icons**

[Detailed description of icon generation and their characteristics from Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/icons/)

Tauri has a very convenient and super-simple tool for generating all the necessary icons for an application. What you need to do:

1. Upload a PNG image with a transparent background to the image directory "**src-tauri/icons**". The resolution should be **1024x1024**, this is the maximum icon size for MacOS, so that everything is displayed beautifully.
2. Run the Tool for generating icons from the <u>root of the project</u>:

```
npm run tauri icon src-tauri/icons/app-icon.png
```

**That's it. All the necessary icons of all sizes for all platforms will be generated.**
